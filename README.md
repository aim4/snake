## How to Run

- [Install love2d](https://love2d.org) *(Fairly simple, for windows you need to point to your love execution file. Follow instructions in link)
- Run `git clone git@github.com:aim4/snake.git`
- Run `love .` where the "main.lua" file is

* Note: I am using WSL on Windows 10 and the Windows Terminal. I had to create an alias to love in my .bashrc file:
`alias love="~/../../mnt/c/Program\ Files/LOVE/lovec.exe"`
** Remember not to modify Linux files using Windows Terminal/other Windows apps and tools (read more [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/do-not-change-linux-files-using-windows-apps-and-tools/).
